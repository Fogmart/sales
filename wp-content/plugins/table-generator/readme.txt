Create unlimited comparison tables without touching a single line of code.

== Description ==
Do want to create visually-appealing and responsive comparison tables but don't want to fiddle with HTML? If yes then you will find this plugin extremely useful. It comes with a powerful table creator using which you can create complex tables with ease. Integrating the table into your website is also simple. All you have to do is add the following shortcode to any post or page:

`[wptg_comparison_table id="1"]`

**Features:**

**Simple Interface:** Using the plugin is extremely easy. Even if you are completely unfamiliar with HTML and PHP, you will find it straight-forward and simple. When creating or customizing a table you can resize it, swap rows and columns and perform other tasks.

**Icon Support:** With the help of placeholders like %TICK% and %HEART% you can add a variety of icons to your tables. You will find the complete list of placeholders under the table maker in your admin area. The icons are added with the help of a font which means you can change their colors with CSS.

**Seamless Integration:** If your theme's stylesheet contains CSS styles for regular HTML tables then the tables created with this plugin will integrate seamlessly into your existing pages. We have intentionally not added any styling so that the theme can take over.

If you like this plugin please give it a good rating.

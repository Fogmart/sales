== Description ==
 
WeCashUp is a Universal Payment Platform that enables online organizations around the globe to accept any Cash, Mobile Money, Bank Mobile Wallet, Cards and Crypto-currency payments on their web and mobile apps via a single REST API integration. We focus on helping online companies to get paid online in the emerging markets such as Africa, Latin America, South Asia and East Europe where people generally don't use traditional Credit or Debit cards. The API works for both pull and push payments. With WeCashUp, online merchants can collect and push payments from/to any of the 155 Mobile Money wallets available in Africa (M-PESA, Orange Money, MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money, Tigo Cash etc), any Credit Card network (Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc) and any Crypto-Currency wallet (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple etc).
